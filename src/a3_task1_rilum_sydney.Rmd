### Interactive Map

```{r}
# Set tmap viewing mode to interactive
tmap_mode("view") 

# Make an interactive map

  tm_shape(oil_spill) +
  tm_dots(col = "sienna2")
```

### Static Choropleth Map

```{r}

  filter(inlandmari == "Inland")  

# Spatial join
ca_oil_spills_inland <- ca_counties %>% 
  st_join(oil_spills_inland)

# Find counts of inland oil spill events by county 
inland_spill_counts <- ca_oil_spills_inland %>% 
  count(name)

# Plot a choropleth map
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = inland_spill_counts, 
          aes(fill = n), color = "white", size = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("lightgray","orange","red")) +

       y = "Latitude", 
       title = "2008 Inland Oil Spills")
